Bugs in Course.java
-----------------------
- Project would not build with the @Serial annotation after import wildcards were fixed according to the Java Style Guide. Fixed by removing the @Serial annotation.
- enrollStudent() had incorrect implementation logic (failed unit tests). 
- dropStudent() had incorrect implementation logic (failed unit tests).
- getCourseLocation() had incorrect implementation, and rather than returning the course location, returned the instructor's name (failed unit tests).
- getInstructorName() had incorrect implementation, and rather than returning the instructor's name, returned the course location (failed unit tests).


Bugs in Department.java
----------------------------
- getNumberOfMajors() returns the negative of the number of majors (failed unit tests).
- getDepartmentChair() returns the string "this.departmentChair" instead of the department chair (failed unit tests).
- toString() returns the string "result.toString()" rather than result.toString()
- dropPersonFromMajor() needed an if statement for correct implementation (so there would not be negative students in a major).
